            <h3>Rule of Thirds</h3>
            <p>McDonald's</p>
            <a href="https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us.html">mcdonalds.com</a>
            <img id="md-pic" src="images/rule-of-3rds-example-mcdonalds.PNG" alt="mcdonalds rule of thirds">
            <p>The Rule of Thirds is the idea that it is more pleasing to the eye
                to view content that is placed on the 'thirds' of an area as opposed
                to it being centered, or otherwise symmetrically placed. In
                application of the Rule of Thirds, you would divide the image or
                content into a 3x3 grid of equal proportions and ensure that the
                content was placed on the dividing lines. In this example, you can
                see how the food is placed in the bottom third and the right-most third
                of the image.

            <h3>Fitt's Law</h3>
            <p>Indeed</p>
            <a href="https://www.indeed.com/">indeed.com</a>
            <img id="indeed-pic" src="images/fitts-law-example-indeed.PNG" alt="indeed fitts law">
            <p>Fitt's Law has to do with the length of time it takes a user to be able to
                access the functions they desire to use. It states that the more distance
                there is between a mouse pointer and target area, and the smaller the size
                of the target area, the longer it takes to access. Indeed illustrates this 
                by having large buttons in close proximity to the search bar.

            <h3>Contrast</h3>
            <p>Amazon</p>
            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">amazon.com</a>
            <img id="amzn-pic" src="images/contrast-example-amazon.PNG" alt="amazon contrast">
            <p>Contrast has to do with the visibility of content on the screen based on 
                color choice. Having a dark background with dark font is a poor choice in
                contrast. Amazon illustrates this by choosing dark backgrounds and light-colored
                text to heighten readability.
